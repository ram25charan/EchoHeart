💖 EchoHeart
EchoHeart is a simple web app built to bring a bit of emotional support to your day. Whether you're feeling anxious, sad, or hopeful — and whether you want to be comforted gently or hyped up — this app lets you express your current mood and receive a thoughtful, AI-generated message in return.

It uses Google’s Gemini AI on the backend, with a clean and responsive frontend built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

🌟 What It Does
You pick how you're feeling (e.g., Anxious, Happy, Lonely)
You pick the tone you want the response to be in (e.g., Comforting, Cheerful, Honest)
You get a short, AI-generated message tailored to both your feeling and the tone
It’s designed to feel like a little check-in — a gentle nudge when you need it.
